## Terraform Configuration

### Default Locals Setup

```hcl
locals {
    # Common varibales to use in project
    env_name         = "dev"
    az_region        = "westeurope"
    project_name     = "accentry"
    application_name = "poc"

    # name_prefix which will use in resource naming convention
    name_prefix      = "${local.env_name}-${local.project_name}-${local.application_name}"

    # These tags are being used in all terraform resources and can be add more
    default_tags = {
        project_name        = "accentry"
        owner               = "web"
        environment         = local.env_name
        region              = local.az_region
        application_name    = local.application_name
        managed_by          = "terraform"
        created_date        = formatdate("YYYY-MM-DD", timestamp())
        # Required by Azure Policy
        "Application Name"   = local.application_name 
        # options: Critical, High, Medium, Low
        "Business Criticality" = "Low"        
    }
}
```

### Architecture Approach: Two-Layer Infrastructure

**Resource Separation:**
- **Project Resources:** Shared infrastructure (SQL Server, AKS Cluster, Storage Accounts, Container Registry)
- **Application Resources:** App-specific components (Databases, Container workloads, App configs)

**Security Design:**
- All Azure PaaS services configured with **private endpoints only**
- **AKS cluster** is the only component with public access (via Load Balancer/Ingress)
- Web application runs as **containerized workload in AKS**
- All internal communication through **private networking**

## Resource Naming Convention

### Pattern (Using Terraform Locals)
`{service}-${local.name_prefix}-{instance}`

**Expands to:** `{service}-dev-accentry-poc-{instance}`

### Examples
- `sqlsrv-dev-accentry-poc`
- `vnet-dev-accentry-poc` 
- `aks-dev-accentry-poc`
- `sadevaccentrypoc` (for storage accounts - no hyphens, 24 char max)
- `acrdevaccentrypoc` (for container registry - no hyphens)

### Resource Groups (Project-Level)
**Shared Infrastructure:**
- `rg-networking-${local.name_prefix}` - VNet, NSGs, Private DNS Zones
- `rg-data-${local.name_prefix}` - SQL Server, Storage Accounts, Private Endpoints
- `rg-compute-${local.name_prefix}` - AKS Cluster, Container Registry
- `rg-monitoring-${local.name_prefix}` - Log Analytics, Application Insights
- `rg-security-${local.name_prefix}` - Key Vault, Managed Identities

**Application-Specific:**
- Applications use shared resources but can have:
  - Application-specific databases (in shared SQL Server)
  - Application-specific storage containers (in shared Storage Account)
  - Application-specific namespaces (in shared AKS)
  - Application-specific secrets (in shared Key Vault)
